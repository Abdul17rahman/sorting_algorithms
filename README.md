# Sorting_algorithms

Sorting algorithms are step by step instructions on how data is arranged/sorted inorder for easy access and retrieval. There different forms of sorting algorithms and they all depend on different principal.

Bubble Sort.
	*In this algorithm, the largest element in an array or list is bubbled all the way up to the untill all the elements are sorted.

Insertion Sort.
	*This is achieved by inserting elements into a sorted sub array. Elements are removed from the array and the rest of the elements are right shifted untill the a space is found for the removed element and its inserted into the sorted array.

Selection Sort.
	*This is achieved by selecting the smallest element in an array and swaping it with whichever is the first element if its not it. Here the smallest element or the left side of the array is sorted first unlike in bubble sort.

Quick Sort.
	*An element is selected usually the first one and its assumed to be sorted or put in the middle then all the elements less than this element are shifted to the left and all the elements large than it are shifted to the right. This is called partitioning and its done untill the array is sorted.

Merge Sort.
	*This is also done through the divide and conqour where the array is divided into 2 parts, this is done iteratively for all the remaining parts of the array. They are then sorted and merged together.
